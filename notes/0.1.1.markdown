### changes

- Client.Handler is now more a more flexible type, `com.ning.http.client.AsyncHandler[T]`.
Existing code should function as-is. Code using the client's previous handler type `Response => T` is implicitly lifted into this type.

- Removed lift-json as dependency and added json4s-native. ( I recommend you do too! ) For most client code, this only means you need to substitute lift-json imports for json4s imports

- Added support for the [Hooks api](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/).

- Added support for [pubhubing](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#pubsubhubbub).

Go out hubbing tonight.

    import hubcat._
    // let me know when someone pushes to my repo!
    val github = Client(accessToken)
    github.repo(user, repo)
           .subscribe(RepoEvents.Push,
             "http://requestb.in/1lvilqc1")(as.json4s.Json)()

- Added support for [pull requesting](http://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/).

I'll push if you pull.

    import hubcat._
    val github = Client(accessToken)
    github.repo(user, repo)
          .pulls.create("I want this", "myuser:mybranch").body(
          """Hey I heard you liked pull requests, so I'm submitting a pull request
             |that adds support for submitting pull requests. I hope you like it.
             """.stripMargin
          )(as.json4s.Json)()

- Added support for [status updates](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/).

You know, like [build statuses](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/status-images/)

    import hubcat._
    // requires scope repo or repo:status
    val github = Client(accessToken)
    github.repo(user, repo)
          .statuses("master")(as.json4s.Json)()
